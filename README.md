# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by Microsoft Azure

## Project 1 :  In this project, I build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model. This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Project 2 : This project uses a the Bank Marketing dataset, which contains marketing campaign on phone calls, with input features-both categorical and numerical- like age, job, marital, education, housing,loan, contact, month and campaign etc. The output label 'y' represents whether the marketing campaign was successful or not. 
 We will use Microsoft Azure to set-up a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy and consume it. We will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline.

## Capstone Project : Telco Customer Churn Prediction
This project is about predicting customer churn for telco customers. It used the dataset from Kaggle. It is a classification problem which focuses on predicting whether or not the customers left within the last month (this value is called Churn and it has two values: Yes or No. )
